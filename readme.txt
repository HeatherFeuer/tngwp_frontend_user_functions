This plugin adapts the WordPress User Profile to accommodate additional TNG information for use with custom registration forms. It provides shortcodes to display two levels of user registration, a front-end profile page, a login form, and a reset password form. There is also a sidebar login/logout widget. New registrations are seamlessly integrated with TNG. The login form (shortcode or widget) will log the user into WordPress and TNG. 

== Description ==
This plugin is specifically designed to work as a user interface for WordPress/TNG integrations. It provides shortcodes for both an advanced and simple registration, a front-end profile page, and login/lost password pages. There is also a login/logout widget. This latest version also incorporates Google reCaptcha v3. You can find more information here: https://www.google.com/recaptcha/about/.

Please note that this plugin requires [The Next Generation of Genealogy Sitebuilding](http://www.tngsitebuilding.com/); however, the tng-wordpress-plugin is no longer required. This plugin will now work as a stand-alone solution for any form of integration used.
